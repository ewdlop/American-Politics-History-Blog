When a narcissistic individual refactors a codebase, they may prioritize showcasing their own skills over the project's actual needs. 

This can lead to unnecessary changes, introducing complexity and potential issues, rather than focusing on genuine improvements. 

Such behavior often stems from a desire for recognition and control, potentially disrupting team dynamics and project timelines.
